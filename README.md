# IndustriesExes.Inc
This repository is the center of IEI.

## Introduction

IndustriesExes.Inc (or IEI) it is a general repository, depending on the categories that will be worked on, other repositories will appear to not make a mess. Only work items that refer to tools and utilities can stay here. Everyone is welcome here just have to have respect for each person. Here will also be the center of the Wiki and Source Code (from projects cited above).

### -"If I have a problem, can I report it here and in other repositories?"

Of course yes, this is important for us to make bug fixes, but depending on your problem, as a project in this repository, you have to testify here. If your problem is from a project from another repository, you can talk there and here.

### -"Can be a contributor?"

Yes but I don't force to participate.

### -"Can I see your source code?"

Yes, the source code is both the work done for the project and an example of things to do but I don't agree to market the code and post it elsewhere. Projects will have a license to control their content.

### -"What will be worked on here?"

Several programming languages will be worked in C, C++, C#, Java, Python, among others.

### -"If I have questions about IEI what do I do?"

Sometimes the Wiki can help you with some information about projects that will come forward like IEIP, IEIP had some problems and its version will come to 0.1 planned was 0.3 but releases were deleted due to problems.
